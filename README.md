# Pipa

### The idea for Pipa is to filter and analyze network data through Pipa jobs

Right now its not filtering or analyzing. I'm working on it. Eventually you will be able to add your own filters (pipa's need filters!), and analyzers (smokers). The idea is that when your app recieves second-hand smoke, it's not dangerous for your app!

Still making Pipa better. This is Basic POC... be patient.
